# STAT408_Github_Project
This is a repository for the final project for STAT408 at Loyola University Chicago in Fall 2024.

There are two files: 

"QuartoFile" has everything I worked on for this project. It is very long.
It might take a good 30-45 minutes to render completely.

"FinalProject" has only the final model and associated plots/tests. Even though
it is trimmed down, it STILL takes a good 20-30 minutes to render.
